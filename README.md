# CodingClub
OSU CSML Coding Club

I lead a weekly coding club at the Ohio State University as part of the Cognitive and Systematic Musicology Laboratory. The goal is to help musicologists and researchers in general develop the skills they need to fetch and manipulate data. I have been focusing on BASH (including the Humdrum Toolkit), but our participants have also been using R, Python, and Perl.

In this repository, you'll find some of the material we have been using, including our Coding Notes.
